NAME
    XML::Literal - Syntax suppor for XML literals

SYNOPSIS
        # This is not a source filter: it just augments glob().
        use XML::Simple;
        use XML::Literal \&XMLin;

        # Simple element
        my $xml1 = <hr/>;

        # With variable interpolation
        my $xml2 = <input value='$ARGV[0]' />;

        # With an extra pair of angle brackets
        my $xml3 = < <a href='/'> Some Text </a> >;

        # With escaped angle brackets 
        my $xml4 = <a href='/'\> Some Text \</a>;

        # Direct call to the xml-building glob'' constructor
        my $xml5 = glob'
            <p><em>
                Some Text
            </em></p>
        ';

        # This does not look like XML, so it's still shell glob
        my @files = <*.*>;

DESCRIPTION
    This module takes one function at its "use" line. Afterwards, all
    single-line "<...>" calls that looks like a XML literal will be
    processed with that function, instead of the built-in shell "glob".

    Support for qx<...> overriding for multiline XML literals is planned for
    Perl 5.10.
